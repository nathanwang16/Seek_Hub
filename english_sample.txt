José Arcadio Buendía, who had not yet recovered from his failure with magnets, conceived the idea of using that invention as a weapon of war. Melquíades, who had already witnessed the death of his illusions, tried again to dissuade him. But he finally accepted two magnetized ingots and three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass.

Úrsula didn't know why her husband wanted the magnifying glass. "It's the end of the world," she said, "and we can see everything clearly with our own eyes." José Arcadio Buendía paid no attention to his wife's objections, but broke the kitchen mortar to make a crucible for melting the metal. He seemed to be driven mad by the papers of Melquíades, asking people to read them to him, though unable to understand their meaning. He finally persuaded a young man who knew nothing of the strange symbols to read the contents, but they might have been in Spanish yet sounded like tales from the Arabian Nights.

Finally, on a rainy night, as José Arcadio Buendía was still working by his crucible, a strange passage flashed into his mind - mostly incomprehensible but seeming like a kind of encyclopedic prediction: "The first man shall be tied to a tree, and the last man shall be food for jaguars."
